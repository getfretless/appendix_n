# Appendix N

Published in 1979, the 1st edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide contained in it an appendix lettered 'N', titled _Inspirational and Educational Reading_. In it is an amazing list of authors and their works, those that inspired Gary Gygax in his creation of Dungeons & Dragons. ([See it here](http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm).) It's sandwiched between Appendix M: Summoned Monsters, and Appendix O: Encumbrance of Standard Items.

There are media that inspire Fretless, too. Some of it is simply stuff we all have enjoyed and found influential. Sometimes, it's stuff half of us have enjoyed and found influential. Sometimes - for instance, Pacific Rim - it's something several of us saw together, and we can't stop referencing it or that event. 

In any case, we've started gathering our list, our Appendix N, right here:

+ Neal Stephenson: Snow Crash (book)
+ Star Wars original trilogy (movies)
+ Ghostbusters (movie)
+ Adventure Time (television)
+ Pacific Rim (movie)
+ Robert A. Heinlein: Stranger in a Strange Land (book)
+ George Orwell: 1984 (book)
+ Alduous Huxley: A Brave New World (book)
+ Frank Herbert: Dune (book)
+ Chuck Palahniuk: Fight Club (book & movie)
+ Jurassic Park and Jurassic World (movies)
